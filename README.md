# [HyperApp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) Boilerplate

The purpose of this example was to create a starting-point for a [HyperApp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) project.

I use  [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) to compile small pieces of code into production files.

I suppose this example can also be used as a starting point for a HyperApp/Rollup app.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Your browser should have automatically launched [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!

You can also view the example app here: [https://phith0n.github.io/hyperapp-startup/](https://phith0n.github.io/hyperapp-startup/).

This will generate a `docs` directory with your minified/rev'd assets.
